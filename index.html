        <p style="font-size:20px;">The waffles got their name from the Middle Low German word ‚Äúw√¢fel‚Äù. The Danish form ‚Äúwafel‚Äù in the 18th century changed to waffle[2][3] and in this form entered the Russian language. It should be taken into account that dry thin crispy waffles (essentially biscuits), familiar to residents of the post-Soviet space, are radically different from soft butter and biscuit waffles, which are known in Europe and America.</p>

         <p style="font-size:20px;">consistency –≥–æ–Ω–≥–æ–Ω–≥—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–∞—Ñ–ª–µ–π: Soft waffles made from egg yeast dough. They are baked in a special waffle iron, which gives them the shape of rectangular plates with hemispherical protrusions (cells), vaguely reminiscent of chicken eggs in shape. Hong Kong waffles are usually served hot, and topped with fresh berries, fruit, sweet sauce and ice cream, just like Belgian waffles; however, they can also be eaten plain.</p>

         <p style="font-size:20px;">consistency Danish waffles: The tough waffle dough is made from flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk and eggs. Medium-sized balls of dough are placed on a waffle iron. After baking, the still warm waffle is cut into two halves. The hot filling, made from brown sugar syrup, butter and cinnamon, is placed between the waffle halves, sealing them together.</p>

They are large in size and round in shape. In terms of consistency and serving methods, they are no different from Belgian ones, but instead of yeast and butter, they usually add baking powder and margarine[4].</p>
         <h2 id="panc" style="font-size:40px;">So, we're done with waffles and moving on to American pancakes UwU</h2>

         <h2>and so first we will start with the cooking method</h2>
         <p style="font-size:20px;">Easy to prepare. A special frying pan is often used to cook them [source not specified 587 days]. With the help of such a pan, pancakes are baked very quickly, and they do not need to be turned over. A pancake pan can be ordinary, in which the pancake is manually turned over to the other side with a spatula. In this case, the readiness of the pancake is determined by the appearance of bubbles on the surface, after which the pancake is turned over and fried on the second side for no more than one minute</p>

         <p style="font-size:20px;">pancakes should be thick enough ‚Äî at least 0.5 cm ‚Äî round, ruddy. When serving, they are stacked, served 2-3 pieces per serving [source not specified 587 days]. Pancakes can be accompanied by a variety of additives: berries (blueberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc.), fruits (bananas, apples, pears), chocolate, various cereals, honey, etc., which are either kneaded into the dough or served separately</p>
         <h1>Cultural significance</h1>
         <p style="font-size:20px;">The British and the English-speaking population of Ireland, Australia and Canada traditionally bake pancakes on "fat Tuesday" ("forgiven Sunday" before the beginning of Lent)[the source is not specified for 587 days]. On this day, many English housewives compete for the right to participate in the "pancake race" ‚Äî a 400-meter race among women carrying a hot pan with a pancake in their hands, which should be thrown at least twice on the run. The race starts at 11 a.m., when the church bells ring. The winner is the participant who manages to toss and flip the pancake in the pan the most times</p>
